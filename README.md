# What

The VDJ echo annoyed me because there's too much zipper noise when you move the delay time so I made another one

FEATURES OF THIS ONE:
 - Just two knobs (time and feedback)
 - Turns down the delayline input as you turn up the feedback so your limiter doesn't explode
 - 100% feedback activates LOCK MODE, where your samples enter an infinite loop :3
